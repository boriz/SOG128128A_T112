# Arduino demo
Simple circles animation.

## Hardware / Wiring
The demo uses an ESP32 Dev Module with the default SPI pins.  
The reference current is set to 16.625uA, via a 750K reference resistor.  
The OLED module wired to the ESP32 like this:

| OLED pin # | Symbol | ESP32 pin|
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | VSS | GND |
| 2 | SI | GPIO 23 (SPI MOSI) |
| 3 | SCL | GPIO 18 (SPI SCK) |
| 4 | A0 | GPIO 17 |
| 5 | RES | GPIO 21 |
| 6 | CS | GPIO 16 |
| 7 | IREF | 750K resistor to GND |
| 8 | VDD | 3.3V from ESP32 |
| 9 | VSS | GND |
| 10 | VCOMH | 4.7uF capacitor to GND |
| 11 | VPP | Panel supply voltage, 15V |
| 12 | VSS | GND |

Note: The demo code is largely generated by AI.
